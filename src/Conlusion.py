Through our comprehensive analysis of the telecom dataset, we discovered that **certain customer behaviors and contract attributes are strongly linked with customer churn**. 

- **Contract Type**: Customers on *month-to-month contracts* are significantly more likely to churn compared to those on longer-term contracts.
- **Monthly Charges**: Higher charges correlate with increased churn, indicating sensitivity to pricing.
- **Tenure**: Customers with a short tenure are more likely to leave, possibly due to poor onboarding or unmet expectations.

- **Bundle longer-term contracts**: Offer incentives for yearly plans to improve retention.
- **Target high-risk groups**: Use churn likelihood scores to trigger retention actions for customers with high bills and short tenure.

-  **Expand dataset diversity**: Include customers from other states and consider data from competitors.
-  **Add behavioral data**: Incorporate usage patterns like call/data usage and customer support history.
-  **Enable real-time ML**: Integrate prediction systems into live dashboards or alerts.
-  **Improve model explainability**: Use SHAP or LIME to provide transparent model insights to business teams.
